    D-pad left/right = rotate ship
    D-pad up/down = fly the direction you're facing

Objective:

* Fly left and right along the surface of the planet and land on four different stations.
* You can only land on the station with the letter on your compass(top left of UI), which will also tell you the direction of the station you want(left/right/down).
* When landed on a station, the resource bar for said station will go up and you will earn points.
* Then fly just bellow the mothership(that other ship scrolling right accross the screen), and it will autodock with you.
* Once it has collected the resources, it will release your ship, and your compass will tell you where to go next.
* If the 900s timer(bottom right of UI) reaches zero, you lose
* If you deliver all four resources, you win
